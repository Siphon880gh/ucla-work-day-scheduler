Work Day Scheduler
=====
Assigned to Weng Fei Fung. A work day scheduler that lets you schedule events for the day. It'll break down the day into work hours which are color-coded to indicate past, present, or future. You can easily add events to hours and save them. The events will load back up the next time you open the app.
